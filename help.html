       <h1>How to use plugins on SRPG Studio</h1>        
         
       <div class="sector">
            Each folder in this project correspond to one of the plugins. Each plugin has at least one .js (Javascript) file, and another file called $readme.txt. <br>
            The readme file has specific instructions on how to make the plugin work.
            To use the plugin, drag the folder to the Plugin folder of your project and follow the instructions of the readme file. <br>
            Note that all readme files start with the '$' character. That is because every file that doesn't start with that character will be considered as part of the code, and that can crash the game. 

            <h2>Generic instructions for all plugins</h2>
            There are some aspects that are common to most plugins, so instead of explaining them in each indivdual file, they will be covered here.

            <h4>Custom Parameters</h4>
            This are custom information that you can write in an object on your project's database. Those parameters are used for some plugins. For example, the Weapon Rank plugin has a parameter to set the rank of an unit. <br>
            Generally, in the place where you can modify something, there is a button called Custom Parameters where you can write them. How each parameter works depends on the plugin, but in general, all parameter must be separated by a ',' and must be under a pair of brackets {}. Even if the parameter are from different plugins, all must be insisde the same brackets. <br>
            For example: {paramA: "Hello", paramB: 15, paramC: true} <br>
            Here we wrote three parameters with different types of values. The first is a string of characters, the second a number and the third a boolean value (true or false). 

            <h4>Global Parameters</h4>
            This works exactly the same as the custom parameters, but instead of being something applied to an object, they apply to the entire game. The global parameters are located in Database->Config-Script->Global Parameters.

            <h4>ID</h4>
            Almost every element in the engine has an ID. Units, classes, weapons, items, weapon types, etc. <br>
            The ID is a number that identifies that object in its own category. This means that if an weapon has a number assigned, no other weapon has the same number assigend. But a different object, like a class, could have the same ID as that weapon, as long as that number has not been used already for some other class. <br>
            This is used in some plugins as a value for some custom parameters. For example, a plugin could need the ID of a skill in the custom parameter of an unit. If the skill has ID 15, the something like {skill:15} could be used in some plugin. <br>
            Note that by default, the engine doesn't show the ID's of the objects in the database. To make them visible, you need to go to Tools->Options->Data and check the option "Display id next to data name".

            <h4>Original Data</h4>
            Original Data is a type of data that doesn't do anything by itself, but it can be used for some plugins to store specific information in a way that can't be done with other types of data, like skills or states.
            By default, this data is disabled: in order to access the Original Data window, you need to go to Tools -> Options -> Expert -> Display original data in config tab.
            Once you do that, you'll have access to the Original Data button in the Config tab of the Database window.

            <h4>Execute Script</h4>
            In some cases, a plugin may ask you to make an Execute Script event to make it work. To do this, you need to create an event, inside that event make a event command and choose the Execute Script event. 
            Depending on the plugin, this event may ask you to check the "Execute Code" or the "Event Command" option. The details will be explained in each individual plugin that uses this type of event.

            <h4>Compatibility Issues</h4>
            Just like mods in other games, plugins are not always compatible with each other. <br>
            Unfortunely, the problem is a bit technical, so a person that doesn't know about programming may not understand it. In simple words, everything in the code is around a system of functions made by the developers of the engine. <br>
            To make a plugin, you modify those functions, and sometimes if two plugins try to modify the same function, only one of them will be executed. This will bring a problem with the plugin that can't use the function, making the plugin have issues or even crashing the game. <br>
            In general, the readme file will specify if there is some compatibility issue. That is, it will have a list of all the functions that have incompatibility with other plugins. This means that if other plugins use those functions, those plugins may not work correctly.
